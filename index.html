	<h2>MY STORY</h2>
			<P>I grew up in a famiy of six. My two great, loving parents raised me and my three gorgeous sisters. Until a few years ago, my home was a large coastal city in Valencia, Venezuela. My country was once a beautiful paradise in South America, but over the last decade, politics and corruption have devasted its economy, people, and rule of law. When I was 16 years old I began to work and travel to the U.S. and other countries. Years later, I returned to Venezuela to attend law school where I graduated in 2014. I love climbing. hiking, movies, and politics, but my four boys are my biggest love and joy.</p>
