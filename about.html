<h1>Starting at Galvanize!!!</h1>
	<p>
	After being accepted at Galvanize, I quickly relocated to Boulder, a town I fell in love with when I first visited ten years ago after one of my sisters moved here with her husband and children. Living in Boulder and becoming a software developer is the realization of two dreams at once. I have not stopped smiling since arriving in Boulder a week ago. I look forward to making new friends and acquiring valuable skills.
